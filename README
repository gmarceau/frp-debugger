From lower level of abstract to higher level of abstraction:

  jdwp_spec2.ss : packet specification
  jdwp_spec3.ss : scheme function that construct packets according to the specs in jdwp_spec2
  codec.ss : implements marshalling and unmarshalling of value according to the rules of the jdwp
  jdwp.ss : query and listen to jdwp replies
  jdi-symbol-table : High-level Scheme operation on Java values
  jdi.ss : imperative style debugging primitives
  jdb.ss : FrTime debugging utilities

This project implement the jdwp binary protocol, which is used to debug java
programs. 

As of Tue Jan 27 18:40:31 2004, it is just comming together. I can talk to a
running java program and get the values of the local variables. 

This project started as a translation of the ruby-jdwp project, at
http://rubyforge.org/projects/rubyjdwp/
